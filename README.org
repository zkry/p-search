* p-search

  p-search is an Emacs tool to find things.  It combines concepts from
  information retrievial and Bayesian search theory to assist a user
  in finding documents.

  Boolean searches (i.e. the document contains the word "X"), while
  simple and useful, ofthen don't match the prior beliefs of the
  searcher concerning where the relevant files are.  Often times the
  searcher has specific ideas as to where the document is located.
  Like what type of file it is, who authored the document, when the
  document was created.  The searcher often times isn't fully
  confident as to how the seach terms appear or whether they appear at
  all.

* Instalation

  Until p-search is available on ELPA/MELPA, you will have to install
  this package manually.  The only dependency of p-search is [[https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/heap.html][heap]].

  Using Quelpa:
#+begin_src lisp
  (quelpa '(p-search :repo "zkry/p-search" :fetcher github))
#+end_src

  Using Straight:
#+begin_src lisp
  (use-package p-search :straight (:host github :repo "https://github.com/zkry/p-search.git"))
#+end_src


  Using Elpaca:
  #+begin_src lisp
    (use-package p-search :elpaca (:host github :repo "https://github.com/zkry/p-search.git"))
  #+end_src

* Usage

  A search session can be initiated with the =p-search= command.  The
  command will set up the session to search for files either in the
  projects directory (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Projects.html][project.el]]) if a project exists or the
  current directory. Execute =p-search= with the prefix ~C-u~
  to instantiate an empty session (TODO).

** The p-search buffer

   The p-search session is composed of three main sections: Candidate
   Generators, Priors, and Search Results.

   [[./documents/p-search-demo-1.png]]


*** Candidate Generators

    Candidate generators are the parts of the search session that
    enumerate all possible search candidates.  A search candidate is
    an entity with a set of key/value properties, ='content= and ='title=
    being mandetory.  Other properties may exist which will allow you
    to use additional prior functions.  In the p-search session run
    =p-search-add-candidate-generator= (~C~)to add a new candidate generator.

    You can delete a prior with the command =p-search-kill-entry-at-point=.

*** Priors

    The Priors section is the part where you add search criteria to
    your session.  Run =p-search-add-prior= (~P~) to add a prior function.

    First you must select the type of prior you want to add.  Then you
    will have to configure the prior.  It will first prompt you for
    any fields that are mandetory.

    After that, a new transient menu will appear, allowing you
    configure the prior.  Each prior function will have its own set of
    inputs and options, but each one will let you set its *importance*
    and whether the *complement* should be taken.

    You can delete a prior with the command =p-search-kill-entry-at-point= (~k~).


*** Calculation

    Each candidate document is given a score from each prior function
    depending on how well the prior function matches.

    So for example, suppose you have a text query search.  The query
    will rank each document on a scale from 0 to 1.  This score is
    then modified by the importance.  If you assign a high importance,
    then the probabilities will be pushed to the extremes. A low
    importance pushes the probabilities to 0.5, thus lowering its impact.

    So for example, if a text search query marked a document as highly
    relevant, 0.7, but was given a low importance, its probability may
    be modified to 0.55, thus lowering its impact.  On the other hand,
    if a text query matches poorly giving a score of 0.3 but its
    importance is low, then its probability will be raised to perhaps
    0.45.

  |
  |\-- DOC_B ->  importance_X(Score_X_B) ✖ importance_Y(Score_Y_B)  ...
  |
  \--- DOC_C ->  importance_X(Score_X_C) ✖ importance_Y(Score_Y_C)

*** Text Search

    Text search is a prominent component in p-search.  While text
    search functions the same way as other prior functions (resulting
    in a score of 0 to 1), the mecahnisms behind it are more complex.

    You can create a text query by selecting "text query" in the
    transient menu when running =p-search-add-prior=.

    You will then be prompted for your query. Depending on the query
    you write, one or more processes will be created to perform the search.

    As mentioned earlier, each search candidate document has a
    property ='content=.  The text search is performed on this field.
    As you can probably immagine, having to search each document on a
    single Emacs Lisp thread is slow, so each candidate generator
    function can have a quicker method to perform the search.  This is
    why you see the search tool like =:grep= or =:rg= on the FILESYSTEM
    candidate generator.  When performing a text query on documents
    coming from this, it will rely on this tool to perform the search.

    For the text query, each search term is space separated.  So if
    you type =teacher student school= it will perform three separate
    searches for the three terms.  Each term will generate its own
    score for each document and they will then be combined to form a
    final score.  You can use quotes to group words to search
    something as a whole, thus ="teacher student school"= will perform
    one search with the words in a sequence.

    Unquoted terms will be processed into multiple variants and
    searched in parallel.  So for example =teacherStudentSchool= will
    search both "teacherstudentschool" (case insensitive), but also
    "teacher_student_school", "teacher-student-school" (with a lower
    score), and the sepearate terms "teacher", "student", and "school"
    (given even a lower score).

    You can boost a term with =^= so that =teacher student^ school= will
    give a boost to student.  You can also specify a numeric boost, as
    in =teacher student^2 school^3=.

    You can search for terms that occur near to one another with the
    =(term1 term2 ...)~= syntax.  Depending on the value of
    =p-search-default-near-line-length=, the items will be required to
    be within a certain number of lines from one another.

** Observation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       360EC6A5-F76A-45E9-9797-F2992CE64FEC
   :END:

   p-search will only show you the first =p-search-top-n= values of
   the search results.  If you are not seeing relevant results you may
   want to consider adding search criteria. You can also run the
   command =p-search-observe= to lower the probability of a particular
   result.  Doing so will lower the probability of the item by
   multiplying it by 0.3. With prefix =C-u p-search-observe=, you can
   specify the probability.  After you perform the observation the
   probabilities will be recalculated and the results will update.


*** p-search-peruse-mode

    =p-search-peruse-mode= is an experimental global minor mode, that
    when active, will track the percentage of files that you viewed.
    The view percentage will be updated in the search results section.

** Saving Sessions

   p-search contains a number of mechanims to speed up your searching
   process.  On the one hand, you can programatically create a command
   and call various p-search functions to instantiate a session to
   your liking.  On the other, simply
   bookmarking the session using the command =bookmark-set= (usually
   bound =C-x r m=) will let you save the session, candidate
   generators and priors, to quickly access in the future.

   Another way to configure the behavior of p-search is by setting the
   variable =p-search-default-command-behavior=.  By setitng it's
   value globally you can configure how the command =p-search=
   behaves.  You can also set the variable via a ".dir-locals.el"
   file, like as follows, to have directory-local settings:

   #+begin_src lisp
((p-search-mode . ((p-search-default-command-behavior . (:candidate-generator p-search-candidate-generator-filesystem :args ((base-directory . "~/dev/go/delve/cmd")))))))
   #+end_src

   You can run the command =p-search-show-session-preset= to see the
   current session represented as a Lisp object.  By passing this data
   structure to the function =p-search-setup-buffer=, you can
   programatically create the p-search session that you want.

** Extensions

   p-search was designed to be extensible, both in what you can search
   on and how the search is performed.  Add `(require 'psx-info')` to
   load a p-search extension whilch lets you search on info files.

   [[./documents/psx-info-demo.gif]]

   This package adds a new candidate generator for info files.  The
   above example shows a search with two different info files.
